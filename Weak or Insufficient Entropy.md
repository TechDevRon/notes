This technique will cover a scenario where random number generation suffers from poor or insufficient entropy. As discussed earlier, entropy refers to the unpredictability or randomness in a system, often derived from sources like environmental factors (e.g., hardware noise or user interactions). When these entropy sources are weak or insufficient, the generated random values are not truly random and become vulnerable to attacks.

For example, if an encryption key is generated using low-entropy data, such as a `timestamp`, an attacker could use this predictable information to reduce the complexity of finding the key. Similarly, poor entropy sources, like `system clocks` or `predictable user inputs`, can lead to weak randomness in applications.

after completing the ctf:
- **Weak Entropy in Token Generation**: In this case, the system relies on low-entropy sources (`username` and `timestamp`), which makes the token predictable. High-entropy tokens are typically generated using secure random number generators (e.g., `random_bytes()`) that produce values with a high degree of unpredictability. Using predictable sources like `time()` does not provide sufficient entropy, making it easy for an attacker to narrow down possible token values. Even though the timestamp changes every second, this predictable increment does not contribute to strong entropy. An attacker could run a brute-force attack using known timestamps within a specific time window (such as within a minute or two from when the token was generated).
- **Small Search Space**: The second major weakness comes from the limited `search space`. A search space refers to the total number of possible values a token could take. A larger search space makes it exponentially harder for attackers to guess or brute-force the correct token. However, in this case, because the `time()` function updates every second, the search space for brute-forcing the token is very small. An attacker could simply guess all possible timestamps within a short time range, say within the last 5 or 10 minutes.

Insecure randomness occurs when web applications use predictable or poorly generated random values, making them vulnerable to attacks. While randomness is essential for securing tokens, session IDs, and cryptographic keys, insecure implementation can allow attackers to exploit these predictable values to bypass authentication, hijack sessions, or even decrypt sensitive data.

## Learning Objectives

﻿Throughout this room, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the following key concepts:

- Understanding insecure randomness  
    
- Type of random number generators
- Weak or Insufficient Entropy 
- Predictable seeds during token generation

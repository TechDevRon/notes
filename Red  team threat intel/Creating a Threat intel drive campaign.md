The task flow in this room logically follows the same path you would take as a red team to begin planning a campaign,  

1. Identify framework and general kill chain
2. Determine targeted adversary
3. Identify adversary's TTPs and IOCs
4. Map gathered threat intelligence to a kill chain or framework
5. Draft and maintain needed engagement documentation
6. Determine and use needed engagement resources (tools, C2 modification, domains, etc.)

The hardest part of planning a threat-intel-driven campaign can be mapping two different cyber frameworks. To make this process simpler we have provided a basic table comparing the **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain** and the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Cyber Kill Chain**|**MITRE ATT&CK**|
|Recon|Reconnaissance|
|Weaponization|Execution|
|Delivery|Initial Access|
|Exploitation|Initial Access|
|Installation|Persistence / Defense Evasion|
|Command & Control|Command and Control|
|Actions on Objectives|Exfiltration / Impact|

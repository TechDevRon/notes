As previously mentioned, the red team will leverage CTI to aid in adversary emulation and support evidence of an adversary's behaviors.

To aid in consuming CTI and collecting TTPs, red teams will often use threat intelligence platforms and frameworks such as **MITRE ATT&CK**, **TIBER-EU**, and **OST Map**.

These cyber frameworks will collect known TTPs and categorize them based on varying characteristics such as,

1. Threat Group
2. Kill Chain Phase
3. Tactic
4. Objective/Goal

After a target is selected, the next goal is the recognize all TTPs, and categorized with that chosen adversary and map that to a known cyber kill chain 

Leveraging TTPs is used as a planning technique rather than something a team will focus on during engagement execution. During the execution of an engagement, the red team will use threat intelligence to craft tooling, modify traffic and behavior, and emulate the targeted adversary.
